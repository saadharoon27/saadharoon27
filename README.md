# Hi, I'm Saad! 👋

I'm a data enthusiast driven by a passion for turning data into actionable insights. My journey into analytics began in middle school when my family's business faced challenges. That experience ignited my curiosity for statistics and trends.

## Education 🎓 🚀

I pursued a Bachelor of Business Administration degree at **iLEAD College, Kolkata**, where I honed my statistical skills and explored basic analytical tools like **Microsoft Excel**. Now, I'm eager to advance my skills through a **Master's in Business Analytics** at **Queens University Belfast**. My focus will be on using more advanced tools like **R**, **SQL** **Python**, **KNIME**, **Power BI**, and **Tableau** to analyze data and derive meaningful insights.

## Professional Experience 📊

During an internship with an ed-tech startup, I applied data analysis techniques and realized the importance of effective communication. This experience further fueled my interest in data analytics.
